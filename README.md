# info3300-interactive-d3-visualization
This is my second class project from INFO 3300 (Data-Driven Web Applications) that uses d3 library to visualize global languages and dialects across the world interactively. The two world maps respectively show the most spoken language families distributions and the countries that have people speaking top 11 languages around the world.
